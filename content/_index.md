Welcome to my blog.  A little about me: My day job is as an Oracle DBA.  I have been doing this job since 1997.  Things have changed alot in those years.  I still enjoy working with computers and learning new things.  I am also a Christian.

My intent with this blog is to post stuff about Oracle databases, but also other computer related topics.  I will also be posting Christian related content.
