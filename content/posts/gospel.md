# Revelation 20
11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.  The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.  12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.  Another book was opened, which is the book of life.  The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13  The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.  14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.  The lake of fire is the second death.  15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.

## Now what?
So, this is the end we are facing.  The end times.  If your name is not in the Book of Life, then we are judged by what is in the other books.  I don't know about you, but I know there is some stuff I have done for which I am not proud, and is likely in those other books.  The Book of Life is key.  How we can get in the Book of Life? That is the Good News, the Gospel.

# Romans 10
9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  11 For the Scripture says *Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame*.  12.  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.  13 For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

## Summary
The Gospel is very simple.  We are all sinners, facing an eternal death in the lake of fire, but we can be saved by believing that Jesus died on the cross, and was raised from the dead.  He paid the penalty for our sins through his death on the cross.

I have been meaning to post something like this for some time, but seeing Revelation 20 presented in [Church][CVBC] today really convicted me.
